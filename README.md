# Personal Website

This is the second iteration of my personal website, this time using Next.js and Tailwindcss. The first version was written using a static website generator called [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) -- which at the time made more sense to me as I didn't have a need for anything super robust. I just needed to create HTML templates, and add markdown files for the site contents. Over time, I realized that I was investing a significant amount of time in adding features that would have taken less time had I used an actual framework or library.
